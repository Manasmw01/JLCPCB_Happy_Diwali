# JLCPCB_Happy_Diwali


> Diwali, the festival of lights has finally arrived.
 And hence, first and foremost, I wish you a very, very Happy Diwali. 
 It is Indiaâ€™s biggest religious festival celebrated across the states. As per Hindu belief Deepavali is the time of conquering evil by good and darkness by light.
There is a special significance of worship of goddess Lakshmi on this auspicious day. It is a belief that goddess Lakshmi brings wealth and prosperity to the households.

# PCB Description
>Diwali lanterns are hung around doorsteps representing enlightenment, knowledge and wisdom.
The lighting of Diwali Lanterns forms a part of celebrations and rituals of the festival.

I have designed a Diwali-Lantern-shaped PCB, consisting of 60 LEDs which can be programmed to turn ON and OFF using any microcontroller to generate beautiful patterns.

# Designed using EasyEDA, Can Order from JLCPCB

This PCB is designed using EasyEDA which is an easy to use PCB design tool.
JLCPCB.com is a well known PCB manufacaturer wherein we can order quality PCBs at low prices. Once the PCB is designed using EasyEDA, we can easily order the PCB from JLCPCB.

# Schematic

> 6 LED arrays, each consisting of 10 LEDs are used and can be controlled using any GPIO pin of a Microcontroller.
